# Combine the Magic from 2 Great Projects
### [rNotebook](http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts) and [html5slides](html5slides.pageforest.com)

See a [demo](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rNotebook_html5slides).

Run in R
```
require(shiny)
runGitHub(username="timelyportfolio",repo="rNotebook_html5slides", ref="gh-pages")
```

This is simply a proof of concept and will serve as a prototype for a much more robust version using [Slidify](http://slidify.org).
